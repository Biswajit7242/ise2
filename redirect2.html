    <h1>Words by Dr. Homi Bhaba</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>My success will not depend on what A or B thinks of me. My success will be what I make of my work</b></li>
        <li><b>For, each man can do best and excel in only that thing of which he is passionately fond, in which he believes, as I do, that he has the ability to do it, that he is in fact born and destined to do it.</b></li>
        <li><b>A scientific institution, be it a laboratory or an academy, has to be grown with great care like a tree. Its growth in terms of quality and achievement can only be accelerated to a limited extent.</b></li>
        <li><b>Words will not speak and the silence freezes into the images of the apartheid</b></li>
    </ul>
